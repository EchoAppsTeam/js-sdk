# Echo JS SDK CHANGELOG:

## v3.0.8 - May 16, 2013

* The "ready" callback was not executed in case an incorrect appkey was specified during the **Echo.UserSession initialization**. As a result, Control or App initialization was stopped on the user creation step. Now the Echo.UserSession initialized with an invalid appkey is considered as an anonymous user (the "ready" callback is being executed).

* Internal logic of the **Echo.Control class** was updated to prevent the "data" configuration parameter from being pointlessly processed by the Echo.Configuration class during Control or App initialization. This improves the **performance of Controls/Apps** in case the "data" parameter is passed in the config. This update also improves the Stream control performance due to the fact that the "data" parameter is used to initialize the Item instances (Stream passes the data to the Item class via the "data" config parameter).

* We added the **"asyncItemsRendering" config option for the Stream control** to trigger the asynchronous items rendering. The option is disabled by default, so the Stream control acts exactly the same. This option is highly recommended for the Streams with the amount of items (roots + children) over 50 on a single Stream page or in case the items contain the UGC content such as images, videos, etc. More information about this option is available in our Documentation Center [here](http://echoappsteam.github.io/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Stream-cfg-asyncItemsRendering).

* The **"Echo.Canvas.onError" event** was added into the Echo.Canvas class to provide the ability to handle errors outside of the class if needed. More information about the error can be found in our Documentation Center [here](http://echoappsteam.github.io/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Canvas-event-onError).

* The **"Post" button** HTML element was changed from \<button> to \<div> to avoid problems when the **Submit control** is installed into the target inside the \<form> element (for example, the button click triggers the \<form> submission in Firefox browser).

* **Echo.API.Request** class logic was updated to use secure (HTTPS) protocol for Echo API endpoint requests in case the "secure" config parameter is set to false or undefined. More information about the "secure" option can be found in our Documentation Center [here](http://echoappsteam.github.io/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.API.Request-cfg-secure).

* **Stream and Counter controls** logic which handles the pre-defined data case (passed via the "data" config parameter) was updated to execute live update requests as we normally do for the regular case when the initial data is being requested from the server side.

* The **"getRelativeTime" function of the Echo.Control class** was updated to display the "Just now" text instead of "N seconds" in case the time passed into the function differs from the current time by less than 10 seconds. More info about this function can be found in our Documentation Center [here](http://echoappsteam.github.io/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Control-method-getRelativeTime).

* The **"Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Submit.onPostComplete" and "Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Submit.onPostError" event contracts were extended** to include the server side API response as a part of the callback handler arguments. More information about the events can be found in our Documentation Center using the following links: [onPostComplete](http://echoappsteam.github.io/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Submit-event-onPostComplete) event, [onPostError](http://echoappsteam.github.io/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Submit-event-onPostError) event.

## v3.0.7 - Apr 11, 2013

* Sometimes when the item was updated, the **item timestamp field was missing** in the UI. The problem was fixed and as a part of the fix we removed the “age” field (which was no longer used) from the Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Stream.Item class instance. Since the field existed for internal usage only, it should not affect the code written on top of the SDK. Anyway if you used the “age” field references in your code, make sure that the corresponding code is rewritten accordingly.

* The Echo.Canvas abstraction was added to work with the application deployments. The abstraction is used primarily in the **Echo.Loader.initApplication** function at this moment to init applications, but it will also be widely used later for other app deployment scenarios. The corresponding code of the Echo.Loader class was refactored to work with the Echo.Canvas abstraction. Note: we do not recommend the Echo.Canvas abstraction usage directly for now, please use the Echo.Loader.initApplication function instead. More information about the Echo.Loader.initApplication function can be found [here](http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Loader-static-method-initApplication).

* The **Twitter Bootstrap UI framework** was upgraded from 2.3.0 to 2.3.1 version. The framework changelog is available [here](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

* The **"PinboardVisualization" plugin** was handling the YouTube video URLs in the item content incorrectly, which prevented videos from appearing in the item UI. Now the URLs processing was updated and the videos should appear in the item UI properly.

* There was a mismatch between the “show user list” option names used in the **"CommunityFlag" plugin** code, the plugin default config object and docs. The [config and docs](http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Stream.Item.Plugins.CommunityFlag-cfg-showUserList) are now synced.

* Incorrect detection of the current user id in the **"Like" plugin** caused invalid label in the Stream item UI for the likes submitted by the current user. The user id detection is now fixed.

* The "itemURIPattern" configuration parameter was ignored by the **Submit control** during the item submission. Now the Submit control is passing the "itemURIPattern" parameter value into the API machinery which takes care of sending the data to the server side. More information about the "itemURIPattern" can be found [here](http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Submit-cfg-itemURIPattern).

* We introduced the new parameter called "useSecureAPI" to all classes based on the Echo.Control or Echo.App class. This parameter is designed to specify the API request scheme (HTTP or HTTPS). More information about the “useSecureAPI” parameter can be found [here](http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Control-cfg-useSecureAPI).

* The **“tags” and “markers” parameter values defined in the Submit control config were ignored** while building the UI for administrators/moderators. The issue was fixed and now the Submit control takes the config values into account.

* When the **Echo.API.Request** class was used directly (without any wrappers like Echo.StreamServer.API.Request, etc), the module was acting incorrectly in case of errors, since the part of the logic existed in the wrappers only. The necessary logic was moved into the base class now to handle the error responses better.

* Under a certain condition the **“onShow” callback in the Echo.GUI.Modal class instance was called twice**. The Echo.GUI.Modal logic was updated to suppress the excessive callback function execution.

* Sometimes the **Echo.Loader.download** function callback was executed before the resources downloading was complete (in case the next scripts chunk downloading had started before the previous chunk was loaded). The issue is originally coming from the [YepNope](http://yepnopejs.com/) loader we use for loading the resources (the corresponding ticket in their [bugtracker](https://github.com/SlexAxton/yepnope.js/issues/113)). We added the logic to avoid the described situation.

* The **HTTP protocol was used by the Echo.Loader class** to download Echo environment scripts on HTTPS pages which caused security warnings in a browser. Now the Echo.Loader detects the page protocol and requests the dependencies using either HTTP or HTTPS.

* The **“TwitterIntents” plugin was renamed to “TweetDisplay”**. The “TwitterIntents” plugin is still available, but it was marked as deprecated and will be removed during the next (v3.0.8) SDK release. If you use this plugin, **please update the plugin name** in your installations. The tweets appearance was also updated to comply with the latest Twitter display requirements.

* The **“select” event has been added into the Echo.GUI.Tabs** class. The event is triggered when the user clicks on the non-disabled, but inactive (not selected) tab. More info about the “select” event can be found [here](http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.GUI.Tabs-cfg-select).

## v3.0.6 - Feb 20, 2013

* **the quirks browser mode is no longer supported**, more information is available [here](http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/guide/technical_specification-section-1).

* several additional **configuration parameters were added to Echo.GUI.Tabs** component. More information about the Tabs library can be found [in our documentation center](http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.GUI.Tabs).

* new **setState method was added into Echo.GUI.Button** component, more information is available [here](http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.GUI.Button-method-setState).

* a **few bugs were fixed in the Echo.GUI.Modal** component which caused malfunctioning in some cases.

* we have added the **ability to set nested entries for Echo.GUI.Dropdown** component. **Separate icons can be specified** for the dropdown itself as well as for each entry. For more information please visit [our documentation center](http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.GUI.Dropdown).

* the **Bootstrap transitions plugin was included** into the Echo.GUI package. More information about this plugin can be found [here](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#transitions).

* **Twitter Bootstrap was upgraded** from 2.2.2 to 2.3.0 version. More information about the Bootstrap updates is available [here](http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2013/02/07/bootstrap-2-3-released/).

* **jQuery was upgraded** from 1.9.0 to 1.9.1 version. The corresponding jQuery release notes are available [here](http://blog.jquery.com/2013/02/04/jquery-1-9-1-released/).

* the SDK code was updated to comply with the latest **jQuery trends** in terms of **checking feature support in the browser** vs checking the browser and its version.

* the **Echo.Loader.download** function is now checking the case when **no resources for downloading have been passed**. In this case the callback is now fired immediately.

* the **input fields of the Submit form** instantiated inside the Reply plugin **were misaligned** when used in conjunction with the PinboardVisualization plugin. We performed some CSS updates to fix the problem.

* the **Stream control UI links** such as item controls or the “Re” tag links **changed their styles** when the “gui.pack.css” was included into the page source. Extra CSS rules were added to prevent this.

* the **logic of the static manifest declarations merging** (in case of inheritance) was updated to check the situation when the function is defined in child manifest and undefined in parent manifest, which caused the problems while calling the parent function.

* the **PinboardVisualization plugin is no longer available in quirks browser mode** due to the fact that the Isotope library used for visualization mechanics doesn’t support the quirks mode at all. The plugin will automatically be disabled if the page works in quirks mode.

## v3.0.5 - Jan 30, 2013

* We’ve **moved Echo Bootstrap plugin wrappers into the Echo.GUI scope**. The $.echoButton and $.echoModal functions have been removed and you should use Echo.GUI.Button and Echo.GUI.Modal classes instead. In addition to the Button and Modal wrappers we also released a few other wrappers which should help you to work with Bootstrap components. The Echo.GUI classes description can be found in the documentation center:

  [http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.GUI](http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.GUI)

* All the Twitter Bootstrap JS files with the Echo.GUI components are now packed into the “gui.pack.js” file. All the CSS rules (Bootstrap and Echo.GUI components) are packed into the “gui.pack.css”. Please make sure to include these files into dependencies if your plugins or apps use Bootstrap components.

* **jQuery was upgraded from 1.8.2 to 1.9.0 version.** This jQuery upgrade is not fully backwards-compatible by itself. You can find the details about the jQuery 1.9 release with the list of the things which were changed or deprecated here:

  [http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/](http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/)

* The **“PinboardVisualization” plugin was moved** out of the main StreamServer JS package (streamserver.pack.js) in order to reduce the size of the package. Now the following plugin script should be included directly into the page source to load the “PinboardVisualization” Stream plugin:
  http://cdn.echoenabled.com/sdk/v3/streamserver/plugins/pinboard-visualization.js

  More information about the “PinboardVisualization” plugin can be found in our docs center:

  [http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Stream.Plugins.PinboardVisulization](http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Stream.Plugins.PinboardVisulization)

* The **events produced by the "Edit" plugin** contained incomplete event names, the "Plugins.Edit" part was missing. The event names generation was fixed and now the proper events are being fired by the "Edit" plugin. If you use subscriptions to the “Edit” plugin events, please update the corresponding code to subscribe using the new event names. More information about the "Edit" plugin itself and the events produced can be found in our docs center:

  [http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Submit.Plugins.Edit](http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Submit.Plugins.Edit)

* The **“appkey” validation was moved** from the base Echo.Control to the specific controls which require “appkey” as a mandatory parameter. Now if your app or control doesn’t require an “appkey” (doesn’t interact with StreamServer or IdentityServer directly), the “appkey” can be omitted in the configuration. For you convenience if you need to check the “appkey”, we added the “checkAppKey” function into the Echo.Control class, so your control or application will have access to this function using the “this” property of the class instance. More information about the “checkAppKey” function can be found in our docs center:

  [http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Control-method-checkAppKey](http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Control-method-checkAppKey)

* The internal logic of the base **Echo.Control class was updated** to consume less memory while creating a JS class from the manifest declaration. In addition to that the logic of the JS class generation was updated to allow multi-level inheritance based on the manifests overrides.

* The **Echo.Loader.initApplication function was added** to provide the unified way of apps initialization on the page. The function performs initial preparations and initializes the app instance. More information about the function can be found in our docs center:  

  [http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Loader-static-method-initApplication](http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Loader-static-method-initApplication)

* **Twitter Bootstrap was upgraded** from 2.2.1 to 2.2.2 version. Bootstrap release notes can be found [here](http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2012/12/08/bootstrap-2-2-2-released/).
* **QUnit library was upgraded** from 1.10.0 to 1.11.0 version. The QUnit lib changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/v1.11.0/History.md).

* **Isotope library** ([http://isotope.metafizzy.co](http://isotope.metafizzy.co)) which is used to power the PinboardVisualization mechanics **was upgraded** from 1.5.21 to 1.5.25 version.

* The **dependencies definition was simplified**. We’ve added an ability to specify the plugin/app/control name instead of the "loaded" function as a part of the dependency object. The “loaded” function was also preserved. You can see the examples here:

  [http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/guide/howtodevelop_app-section-7](http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/guide/howtodevelop_app-section-7)

* The internal mechanics of the **Echo.Utils.timestampFromW3CDTF method was slightly updated**. Now this method can convert any string representation of a date supported by the browser. If the ISO representation is not supported (e.g. in IE8, in IE9 in quirks mode, in Safari on a date with reduced precision) then the Echo.Utils.timestampFromW3CDTF will parse that date string as it did before.

* The **child nodes rendering logic was updated** (in case the PinboardVisualization plugin is enabled for the Stream). By design only root nodes can be the source of the media content, thus all HTML tags are stripped out from the child nodes. More details about the PinboardVisualization plugin can be found in our docs:

  [http://wiki.aboutecho.com/w/page/30181308/Echo%20Application%20-%20Echo%20Stream%20Client#Plugins.PinboardVisualization](http://wiki.aboutecho.com/w/page/30181308/Echo%20Application%20-%20Echo%20Stream%20Client#Plugins.PinboardVisualization)

* The **Echo.Utils.htmlTextTruncate function behavior was changed**. Now if the truncation hits the middle of the word, the word itself is preserved and truncation starts right after this word to improve the text readability.

* The **YepNope library** ([www.yepnopejs.com](http://www.yepnopejs.com)) which we use to download dependencies for controls, apps and plugins was moved under the local Echo scope to avoid conflicts in case another version of the loader exists on the page.

* The **Echo.Configuration class logic was updated** to prevent incoming data damaging during the operations with the config instance. In some cases when you assign the data to the config field, the incoming object was also modified. Now the Echo.Configuration class instance works with the copy of the incoming data, thus leaving incoming data untouched.

* The logic of the **Echo.App class was updated** in order to proxy the configuration parameters into the internal applications initialized using the "initComponent" function. Now the Echo.App class tries to populate the current instance configuration based on the default manifest config keys and the parent object config values.

* The contract of the **Echo.Plugin.isDefined function was updated**. In addition to the plugin manifest definition, the function can also accept the full name of the plugin to check if the plugin was already defined. Now the Echo.App.isDefined, Echo.Plugin.isDefined and Echo.Control.isDefined has the same contract.

* The **Echo.Loader.initEnvironment function became public**. The function helps to initialize Echo JS environment on the page by downloading the necessary scripts. More information about the function can be found in our docs center:

  [http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Loader-static-method-initEnvironment](http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Loader-static-method-initEnvironment)

* The internal logic of the **Echo.Loader.download function was updated** to handle the various cases of multiple resource loading, nested execution of the same function from the callback, same resource multiple loading, etc. More information about the Echo.Loader.download function can be found in our docs center:

  [http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Loader-static-method-download](http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Loader-static-method-download)

* We’ve **changed the avatars display rules** in our components. Prior to this change we supported square avatars only and this could result in distortion of non-square images. This limitation is now removed and the avatar is shrinked proportionally, so the image is displayed without any deformation.

  The Echo.Utils.loadImage and Echo.Control.placeImage methods were also modified. The Echo.Control.placeImage method now positions and shrinks the avatar correctly inside the given container. We recommend you to use that method when you need to insert images of different sizes and proportions into container with fixed dimensions.

  A detailed description of these functions can be found in our documentation center:

  [http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Utils-static-method-loadImage](http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Utils-static-method-loadImage)
  [http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Control-method-placeImage](http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Utils-static-method-loadImage)

* The context generation machinery became a part of the Echo.Events library interface. You can call the **Echo.Events.newContextId function to generate a new unique context ID string**. The function also supports generation of the nested contexts (the parent context should be passed as a first argument). More information about the function can be found in our docs center:

  [http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Events-static-method-newContextId](http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Events-static-method-newContextId)


## v3.0.4 - Nov 29, 2012

- The most important update which we performed within this release is the minification of the JS
 scripts using the UglifyJS software before pushing them to our CDN.
 Now all files from http://cdn.echoenabled.com/sdk/v3/ directory are served minified by default,
 which allowed us to reduce the size of the scripts to 26-84% of the original versions (min+gzip compared to dev+gzip)
 and as a result, reduce the scripts download time. The dev versions (non-minified) of these files are located in /sdk/v3/dev/
 directory (note the "dev" path). The downside of the minification might be the fact that it's inconvenient to debug JS code
 on the site where the app was installed if you don't have access to the source code to switch the minified scripts to development
 versions (for example - any customer's site). Through the instrumentality of SDK dependencies management architecture we were able
 to overcome this problem and added the ability to specify which version you want to download without changing the source code.
 The loader mechanism can recognize certain flags which you can pass through the URL fragment/anchor.
 The value of the flag is saved in a cookie and the loader will use it later to download the corresponding
 minified or development version of the particular script. If there is no cookie defined - the minified versions
 will be used by default. More information about the specifics of the minified -> development scripts switch mechanics can be found in our docs center here:
http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/guide/terminology-section-5

- URL placeholders such as {sdk} and {apps} were removed from the code. Now URLs should use the "cdnBaseURL"
configuration parameter of the Echo.Control class. This parameter was introduced in the SDK v3.0.3 release.
See more information about it  in our documentation center:
http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Control-cfg-cdnBaseURL
Note that Echo.Loader.getURL function was modified to handle relative URLs to SDK resources. More details here:
http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Loader-static-method-getURL .
So if you use these placeholders you should perform some changes using the following rules:
    - Inside the component templates or dependency URLs you should use the {config:cdnBaseURL.sdk} and {config:cdnBaseURL.apps} placeholders instead of {sdk} and {apps} respectively.
    - In other cases you can use Echo.Loader.getURL function providing it with a relative URL to resource. URL is relative to http://cdn.echoenabled.com/sdk/v3/ folder.<br><br>

- The Echo.Cookie class was added to SDK libraries suite. It provides the number of setter
and accessor operations which allow to work with cookies (get/set/remove). The class is used to
power the minified vs development script modes switch state, but you can start using it to work
with cookies in your code. It's available by including the http://cdn.echoenabled.com/sdk/v3/loader.js file.
Documentation for the Echo.Cookie class is available in our documentation center:
http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Cookie

- New items animation machinery was introduced in the Stream control. Powered by native CSS 3
transitions new items come into the stream as live updates fading out more smoothly.
Previously the jQuery plugin was used to power the fading out effect. For the browsers without
the CSS 3 transitions support (IE < 10) the background color of the item is changed from the "flash"
color to the original one without the animation.

- The contract of "set", "get" and "remove" functions of the Echo.Utils library was slightly updated.
Now the "set" and "remove" functions return the boolean result of the operation (true/false).
The "get" function now returns the default value in case the key or the source object is
missing (used to return the source object before).
More information about the above mentioned functions can be found in our documentation center:
http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Utils-static-method-set
http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Utils-static-method-get
http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Utils-static-method-remove

- A couple of issues were fixed in the $.echoModal class. Now the closing modal form action should not
cause errors in IE browsers. Also the issue with the redundant iframe content loading after closing the
modal form was fixed.

- A new "hasCSS" method was added into the Echo.Utils library to check whether the given set of the CSS styles
was already added into the page. The function was employed in the internal factory class which assembles
the JS class using the manifest declaration. It prevent the same CSS rules from being processed for each instance.
This modification contributes to the SDK performance improvement.
More information about the Echo.Utils.hasCSS function can be found in our doc center:
http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Utils-static-method-hasCSS

- The Echo.Utils.timestampFromW3CDTF function internal machinery was updated to use the natively supported
Date JS class functions first before switching to the home-grown implementations (for the browsers which doesn't
recognize the W3CDTF format in some cases). This helped us to improve the function performance and gave a complete
W3CDTF date and time format compliance.

- The relative time calculation logic was extracted from the Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Stream.Item control and placed to
the Echo.Control class to provide an ability for any control/plugin/app to use it.
More information about the newly added "getRelativeTime" method can be found in our docs center:
http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Control-static-method-getRelativeTime

- The internal machinery which generates the JS class from the manifest was updated to define the set of
default language vars once during the JS class generation rather than adding the same set of labels every
time during the class instance initialization.

- The "available" static method of the Echo.API.Transports.XDomainRequest object was extended to check
the certain conditions when XDomainRequest can not be used. The XDomainRequest can not be used when:
    - the method other than GET or POST is used for the request
    - the request protocol doesn't match the caller page protocol (for example, the XDomainRequest can not be
executed if the URL with HTTP protocol is requested within the HTTPS page and vice versa)<br><br>

- The problem with the PinboardVisualization plugin on high-velocity stream was fixed. In some case,
when we receive duplicate items from the server, the activity application mechanism wasn't working correctly and
the animation queue got stuck. The issue is now fixed and tested with both slow and high velocity streams.
Also we updated the Isotope library (which powers the PinboardVisualization rendering mechanics) from 1.5.19 to 1.5.21 version,
which should slightly improve the rendering performance and stability for the streams with the PinboardVisualization enabled.

## v3.0.3 - Nov 13, 2012

- We employed the Bootstrap Modal dialog to display popups. The previously used jQuery Fancybox
was removed from the code base, since it's no longer required. If you use the $.fancybox calls
in your code, please update them employing the $.echoModal library. Example of the library usage
can be found in the Echo.IdentityServer.Control.Auth and Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Submit applications.

- The Bootstrap libraries assembling procedure was updated. Now the Bootstrap lib is represented
as one JS file instead of 2-3 JS and CSS files. The CSS code and extra JS wrappers were packaged
into a single JS file. The CSS rules required for the Bootstrap component are inserted into the page
using the standard Echo.Utils.addCSS function. It helped to reduce the amount of resources required
to load the SDK which reduces the SDK loading time. Please check the "dependencies" section of your App,
Control and Plugin manifests and remove the Bootstrap CSS files usage required for Echo Bootstrap components.

- The interface of the Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Stream.onDataReceive event was updated. Now the "onDataReceive"
handlers are called with the new parameter "type" instead of "initial". This parameter specifies
the origin of data request and provides the ability to identify event producers more precise. More information
about the event and its new interface can be found in our docs center:
http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Stream-event-onDataReceive

- The contract of the Echo.Utils.loadImage was updated. Now the function accepts one argument with
the object type. The "onload" and "onerror" callbacks were added as well to provide better flexibility
for the function users. More information about the function and its new contract can be found in our docs center:
http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Utils-static-method-loadImage

- The Echo.Utils.parseURL function contract was slightly updated. Now an empty string is returned as a value
for the keys which represent the part which was not found in the URL, the "undefined" value was returned
previously in such cases. If you use this function in your code, please make check it and update accordingly.
More information about the Echo.Utils.parseURL function can be found in our docs center:
http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Utils-static-method-parseURL

- The Twitter Bootstrap UI framework was upgraded from 2.1.1 to 2.2.1 version.

- A new "title" configuration parameter was added for the Echo.IdentityServer.Controls.Auth control
to provide an ability to set the auth modal dialog title. More information about the new parameter
can be found in our docs center:
http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.IdentityServer.Controls.Auth-cfg-identityManager

- The "destroy" method called for the dependent control (i.e. when it was initialized within another control)
didn't clean up the target element, the target was cleared only in case the "destroy" was called for the top
level control. Now the target is cleared properly for the dependent controls when the "destroy" method is being called.

- Now the "templates.main" field in the Control or App manifest might be either a string or a function which generates
the template. It provides more flexibility for the templates generation based on the required conditions.

- The empty stream message was displayed incorrectly in case the PinboardVisualization plugin was enabled for the Stream
control. Now the PinboardVisualization plugin doesn't affect the info messages displayed in the Stream control.

- A new "removePersonalItemsAllowed" configuration parameter was added for the Moderation plugin to provide users
with the ability to delete their own items. More information about the new parameter can be found in our docs center:
http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Stream.Item.Plugins.Moderation-cfg-removePersonalItemsAllowed

- The Echo.Utils.htmlize and Echo.Utils.stripTags functions logic was slightly updated. Now the functions process
the argument value only if it's a string type argument and return incoming argument value as is otherwise.

- The Echo.Utils.set function logic was optimized to work with plain keys, i.e. keys without nesting levels
(example of the plain keys: "key1", "key2"; example of the keys with the nesting levels: "key1.key2", "key3.key4.key5").
If the plain key is passed into the function, the part of machinery is not activated to speed up and simplify the process.

- The Echo.API lib and the respective StreamServer, IdentityServer, etc libs were improved by adding the condition
into the JS closure to exit the function in case the given class was already defined on the page.

- The logic of the Echo.API lib was updated to provide an ability to make cross domain AJAX requests using
the POST method. The HTTP method can be defined using the "method" parameter of the Echo.API object instance
creation. More information about the Echo.API lib can be found in our docs center:
http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.API.Request-cfg-method

- A new "settings" configuration parameter was added for the Echo.API library to provide an access to transport
object configuration. More information about the new configuration parameter can be found in our docs center:
http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.API.Request-cfg-settings

- A new "cdnBaseURL" configuration parameter was added for all Apps and Controls. The intention is to collect
different CDN base URLs used in the products built on top of the JS SDK in one single place for consistency purposes.
In addition to the new configuration parameter we updated the dependencies management mechanisms and provided
the ability to use the configuration parameters in the resource URLs. Now the "{config:someKey}" is available
for the URLs defined in the "dependencies" object of the App, Control or Plugin manifest. The idea is to use
the newly added "cdnBaseURL" configuration parameter values in the URLs to give more flexibility for the publishers
and developers to define the location of the resources and avoid the need to update the code itself in case
the base URL is changed. More information about the "cdnBaseURL" parameter can be found in our docs center:
http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Control-cfg-cdnBaseURL

- The internal machinery of the Echo.Utils.htmlTextTruncate function was updated to cache the generated
list of tags used inside the function to prevent the same set of tags generation each time the function is being called.

- The Echo.Utils.log function calls were added into several places where the function execution is stopped
due to the wrong incoming parameters. This should be very useful while developing the applications built on top
of the SDK v3. We will add more annotations like this as we move forward.

- The jQuery Easing plugin which was a dependency for the FancyBox plugin was removed, since it's no longer required
(since the FancyBox was replaced with the Bootstrap Modal).

## v3.0.2 - Oct 11, 2012

- the "Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Stream.Item.onReceive" event fired within
the Stream control, was renamed to the "Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Stream.onItemReceive".
Please rename the event if you use it somewhere in the code.

- the "liveUpdates" and "liveUpdatesTimeout" Stream control config options were
moved into the "liveUpdates" hash and became the "enabled" and "timeout" keys
respectively. The "liveUpdatesTimeoutMin" option was removed. More information
about the "liveUpdates" configuration option is available in our docs center:
http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Stream-cfg-liveUpdates

- the "streamStateLabel" and "streamStateToggleBy" Stream control configuration
options were moved into the "state" hash and became the "label" and "toggleBy"
keys respectively. Documentation for the "state" option is available in our docs
center: http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Stream-cfg-state

- the "Echo.Loader.download" function interface was updated. Now the function
accepts 3 arguments: resources to download, callback and the config. Previously
these arguments were specified as keys of the single object argument. Please update the "Echo.Loader.download"
function calls in your code. Updated information about the function is available in our docs center:
http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.Loader-static-method-download

- the "More" button of the Stream control is now included into the Live/Pause
trigger area, if the "state.toggleBy" config option is defined as "mouseover"
(which is also a default value)

- a new "state.layout" configuration option was added into the Stream configuration.
If the "layout" is defined as "full" - the "apply update" button appears above the
Stream items list when the new item reaches the Stream as a live update. The user
can click on the button to reveal updates. Documentation for the "state.layout"option
is available in ours docs center: http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Stream-cfg-state

- the animation of the new items (received as live updates in the Stream control) was
changed. Now the whole item container and its contents slide in together from the top
as a whole/complete thing

- now the publisher-defined and default configs are merged recursively to let the config
object contain the whole set of controls with the actual values

- the useless "whoami" request calls (when Backplane was not initialized on the page) within
the UserSession object are prevented

- the docs center was also updated. The "High-level overview", "Terminology and dev tips",
"How to develop a control", "How to develop a plugin" and the "How to develop an app" guides
were added. We’ll be working on ongoing basis to put more content into the guides

- now all entries (which represent Echo items) will be normalized before
the "Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Stream.onDataReceive" event publishing from
within the Stream control. Also it is now published for each live update in addititon
to initial data loading and "more" data loading

- new "itemsComparator" configuration parameter was added for the Stream control to provide
an ability to sort the items in a custom order. More information about the configuration
parameter can be found in our docs center:
http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Stream-cfg-itemsComparator


## v3.0.1 - Sep 26, 2012

- the "Echo.Product" class was renamed to "Echo.App".

- the "empty" type used inside the "Echo.Control.showMessage" function
argument was renamed to "info" to be control-agnostic.

- the "Echo.Utils.objectToQuery" function was removed from the public
interface and became the Echo.API library internal facility.

- the "Echo.App.isDefined" and the "Echo.Control.isDefined" functions
were added to check if the app or the control class was defined. These
functions replaced the "Echo.Utils.isComponentDefined" calls in the
control and app scripts.

- the "Echo.Utils.getNestedValue", "Echo.Utils.setNestedValue" and the
"Echo.Utils.removeNestedValue" functions were renamed to the
"Echo.Utils.get", "Echo.Utils.set" and the "Echo.Utils.remove"
respectively.

- the "errorPopup" configuration parameter was added to the
Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Submit control to provide an ability to
define the necessary dimensions for the error message popup raised by
the Submit form in case of error. Documentation for the "errorPopup"
option is available in our docs center:
http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Submit-cfg-errorPopup.

- jQuery library was upgraded from 1.8.1 to 1.8.2 version.

- QUnit library powering the tests infrastructure was upgraded from
1.3.0 to 1.10.0 version.

- the controls are now disabled correctly after the tests were
finished. Previously the controls on the page were producing useless
live update requests.

- new "Echo.Utils.remove" function added to remove a given field in a
given object at any nested level.

- missing dependencies added to the "CommunityFlag", "Edit", "Reply"
and "Like" plugins.

- fixed the race-condition issue in the "TwitterIntents" plugin (IE 7
and 8 were affected).

- implemented CORS support on the transport layer for IE 7 and 8.

- "connection_failure" error is now handled correctly during API
recurring requests.

- fixed the issue which prevents the values like false, null,
undefined, 0 or "" from being defined as the Echo.UserSession instance
field value.

- the "defaultAvatar" option was added to the Stream, Submit, Auth and
FacePile controls. Now you can define the avatar URL to be used as a
default one in the control UI. Documentation for the "defaultAvatar"
option is available in our docs center:
http://echoappsteam.github.com/js-sdk/docs/#!/api/Echo.StreamServer.Controls.Stream-cfg-defaultAvatar

- the "getComponent" function was added to the "Echo.App" class to
provide the ability to access the component by its internal (for the
given App) name.

- fixed the CSS dependencies loading logic used in the Echo.Loader class.

## v3.0.0 - Sep 12, 2012

- Initial SDK release
