   Echo Javascript SDK
   Copyright 2012-2014, Echo

   This product was initially developed at Echo (AboutEcho.com) with 
   contributions by the wider community.

   Echo offers a collection of powerful Cloud Services that do the heavy 
   lifting for real-time, social applications. This SDK is designed to make 
   it easy for JavaScript app developers to consume these cloud services 
   while producing more interoperable and consistent apps by addressing a 
   number of general app development challenges.
